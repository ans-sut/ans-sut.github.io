    Unethical use may include circumvention of existing security or
    privacy measurements for any purpose, or the dissemination,
    promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services.
    Exceptions to these guidelines may occur in the process of reporting
    vulnerabilities through public and authoritative channels. Any
    activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be
    reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from
    the class. When in doubt, please contact the instructor for advice. **Do not**

    anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have received
    explicit permission from Dr. Sadeghzadeh.
